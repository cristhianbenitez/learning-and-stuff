# Learning and stuff

In this repo I'm trying to save things I find important about things I learn on a daily basis and try to elaborate on them to improve my understanding of certain topics or concepts or at least try to. Also general stuff I like, quotes, my personal notes, and anything really (it's my repo I can do whatever I want with it haha).
