# Possible Questions and possible answers

This is just a fictional situation but important to always have questions for the clients before meeting them and as well to think for possible questions they might have for us.

## To the client

- What's your goal for the website?

- What do you like about your current website ?

- What would you like to improve about your website ?

## From the client (here we have our possible answers as freelancers)

- How much is this going to cost ? (frequently asked question)

A lot of this is based on the scope of what the client wants to get done.

- Can you do this for free ? (NEVER)

- How long will this take ? (frequently asked question)

Vary based on the scope of work

- What's the process like ?

Work in 4 different phases.
First is conversation, to get a better understanding of the need of the clients.
Second is content, working with the client on written content, getting the assets together, photos, client work client has worked on.
Third is Design & Develop and finally Test and Deploy.

- What happens if we don't like it ?

Usually the work is done together with client by having regular check ins, so we can get any feedback and revisions will be included on what the client get quoted for the project.

- What about changes on the website ?

The website is developed using a Content Management System. So they can make changes on text, images and more.

- What about design changes ?

For design changes that fall outside of the original scope of the work. And it's important to include an hourly rate upfront for additional work that fall outside of the original agreement.

- Why can't we make the website ourself ? (not a regular questions but interesting to convince clients)

Basically the client can make the website themselves. Of Course they can go through the process in house. That respectable. But a lot of the clients client has kind of the same question.
Why can't they make it themselves ?. But at the end of the day the clients client get more value out of the quality of work the do and out of the time they save by not having to become experts in the field.
That same thing applying to us Freelancers. Our job is to have the expertise, and do all the heavy lifting in our area so the client can focus on doing the best for their clients.
