## 12 essential questions to ask before starting any UX project

These are just essentials questions to ask a client before starting.

1. What is the problem we are trying to solve ?
    - Consider business goals vs user goals. e.g. a website for a yoga teacher. If the yoga teacher was hiring you to make them a website, their business goals would be to build a website to get more clients.

2. Who are we solving for ?
   - Who are the primary target users? secondary ? What is their demographic ( age, race, gender, marital status, occupation, income, education)? Why will they use this product - and what are their needs, goals and pain points.

3. Is there any existing research data web can use ?
     - What does the client already know ?

4. What are the pain points of the current version (if it exists)?
     - If you're working what an established company or product, they may have an understanding of what isn't working already. It is our job to figure out why it isn't working, and come up with solutions.

5. Is there any existing branding or content we can use ?
    - are there brand guideline? Where will we get the copy and the images for the site? You may get this content based on an existing site or brand guidelines, but new sites may not have it yet.
6. When and where will users acces the product ?
      - Consider user environment and context - what device are they on? Where are they when they visit ?.

7. Why are we trying to solve this problem?
     - This question will help you understand the client's business goals.Do they want to increase their revenue? Sell a specific thing better? Make people more aware of their brand? You want to gain insight into your client's goals, and how their differ from the user's goals. Getting an idea of why your client is trying to solve this problem will set you p to measure success effectively.

8. What would success look like for this project?
     - What are our project goals? What is the definition of done?
     - How will we measure success? What are future goals for this product?

9. What are the project’s constraints?
     - What platforms are we designing for? What technologies is the product currently using/will need? What is the timeline and budget like?

10. Who does the project team consist of?
     - What are their names, titles, and roles. You’ll want to get familiar with the team and your points of contact.

11. Who will be the person signing off on things throughout the project?
     - There should be one final decision maker. It can be difficult to agree on solutions with any more.

12. Who will be ultimately responsible for signing off the design?
     - How can we keep stakeholders involved in every step of the process? e.g. if it is the CEO, but she's not involved in the design process at all.
