# **Fundamentals**

## **7 Fundamental Principles of Design by Don Norman**

1. **Discoverabilty**: It is possible to determine what actions are possible and the current state of the device

2. **Feedback**: There is full and continuous information about the result of actions and the current state pf the product or service. After an action has been executed, it is easy to determine the new state.

3. **Conceptual Models**: The design projects all the information about thee result of actions and the current state of the product or service. After an action has been executed, it is easy to determine the new state.

4. **Affordances**: The proper affordance exists to make the desired actions possible.

5. **Signifiers**: Effective use of signifiers ensures the discoverability and that the feedback is well communicated and intelligible.

6. **Mappings**: The relationship between controls and their actions foolows the principles of good mapping, enhanced as uch as possible throuhg spatial layout and temporal contiguity.

7. **Constraints**: Providing physical logical, semantic, and cultural constraints guide actions and eases interpretation.
